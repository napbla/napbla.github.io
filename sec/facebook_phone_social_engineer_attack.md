# Someone may use your phone number to create a new Facebook account and get your friend list
## Abstract (tl;dr)

1. Attacker creates a new Facebook account using your phone number. They may use your name to make it legit.
2. Now Facebook sends you an SMS with an OTP code and some fb.me/xxxxx link to input the code.
3. Curiosity kills the cat, you open the Facebook link and fill in the OTP code.
4. Thanks to Facebook friend suggestion, all your friends is suggested in your new account.
5. Before enabling 2FA, the attacker who still has the password can login to the new account and see the suggested list of your friend.

The attacker now have a new account to sell likes or post craps.

This is simple and stupid and not new but there's a high chance that it will work. Moreover everyone can do it and it costs nothing.

## What to do if you are in this situation
1. Immediately change the password of the newly created account using **Forgot Password** feature. Facebook will send you a code to create new password.
2. Link this account to a junk email address (this is required to unlink your phone from the account).
3. Unlink your phone with the account.
4. Finally disable the account.

## The story
Today after breakfast I received an SMS from Facebook telling me to verify this account.
I think someone has input wrong phone number or this is a phishing attack.
But I still opened the link in an Incognito window and input the code.

Now I realized this is a problem when all of my friends are appear in the suggestion list. 
It also automatically send adding request to a friend of mine who I contact frequently in these days.

I quickly want to remove my phone number but it asked for password which I did not know.
At that time, I think I should change the password to prevent further action of the attacker.
So I pressed the Forgot Password button and changed it. 

I also see the location of the attacker. He is the capital in the North while I live in the South.
Then I input a junk email to remove my phone number and deativate the account. 
However Facebook only deactivates but not delete the account.

Hopefully that this is solved.
